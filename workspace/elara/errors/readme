# The main thing me and Richard had to change was the wscript; specifically:
# all the parts that say
	bld.new_task_gen(...)
# to just:
	bld(...)
# and everywhere that says
	bld.add_subdirs(...)
# to
	bld.recurse(...)

# And then we started getting actual C++ errors with the files such as 

./ns3/priority-queue.h:28:23: error: invalid covariant return type for ‘virtual ns3::Ptr<ns3::Packet> ns3::PriorityQueue::DoDequeue()’
   virtual Ptr<Packet> DoDequeue (void);
                          ^
# Hopefully we can figure out what the issue is

# The wscript in here is from src/priority-queue but it is edited to work with our current environment
